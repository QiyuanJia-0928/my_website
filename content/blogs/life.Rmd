title: Mina's Life Journey
---
* I was born in China and had spent my teenager years till the age of 14 in Shenzhen, a city near Hong Kong before moving to Australia for high school and college. For me, the experience of moving abroad was not an easy journey. I went through severe identity crisis and cultural shock at the beginning. Before that, throughout the years in junior high school, I had always been educated as a typical 'straight A' kid in domestic education system, good at tests but never questioning anything. As the top performing kid, I used to take things for granted. All of a sudden, things changed.

* After moving to Australia, I was not able to understand any single class for the first half of the year, and I struggled to find my self-worth that was previously based on external feedbacks and accolades. I thought to myself one day I really got to think of a way out. I found a part-time job at a store. I told my boss I hope to prove myself. At the same time, I started working on my vocabulary on Apps.My hardwork paid off. My listening and speaking skills really improved. I became more and more active in student community. I gained my confidence back. Things got better and better in college and surprisingly a little detour from my major (an exchange to Wharton) helped me discover what I truly wanted for a career.

* Although, China's education system is flawed for many reasons and there are still controversies around the existing political system. The development and new business models in the recent years only impressed me each time I came back for a visit. As much as I want to work in a global environment, I wish to devote myself to the rapid changes and hopefully in 20 years when I look back, I see my effort has turned into tangible positive impact somewhere.

* _**I am super interested in exploring different cultures, views and I keep myself open to opportunities to live and work in every corner of the world.**_
