title: US yield curve since 1960-01-01

In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). 

```{r load-libraries, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(GGally)
library(readxl)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(broom)
library(tidyquant)
library(infer)
library(openintro)
library(scales)
library(ggtext)
library(tidyr)
```


First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01

```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <- read_csv(here::here("data", "yield_curve.csv"))

glimpse(yield_curve)
```

Our dataframe `yield_curve` has five columns (variables):

- `date`: already a date object
- `series_id`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `value`: the actual yield on that date
- `maturity`: a short hand for the maturity of the bond
- `duration`: the duration, written out in all its glory!


## Plotting the yield curve

### Yields on US Treasury Notes/Bills/Bonds by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis

```{r yield_curve_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

  maturity_name <- c(
  '3m'='3-Month Treasury Bill',
  '6m'='6-Month Treasury Bill',
  '1y'='1-Year Treasury Rate',
  '2y'='2-Year Treasury Rate',
  '3y'='3-Year Treasury Rate',
  '5y'='5-Year Treasury Rate',
  '7y'='7-Year Treasury Rate',
  '10y'='10-Year Treasury Rate',
  '20y'='20-Year Treasury Rate',
  '30y'='30-Year Treasury Rate')

ggplot(yield_curve,aes(x=date,y=value))+
  geom_line(aes(color=maturity))+
  facet_wrap(~maturity,nrow=5,labeller=as_labeller(maturity_name))+
  labs(y = "%",
       x ="",
       title = "Yields on U.S. Treasury rates since 1960",
       caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)"
         ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold",size=15),
         axis.title.y = element_text(size=12),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.position = "none")+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL
```

### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis

```{r yield_curve_2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve2.png"), error = FALSE)

yield_curve1999 <- yield_curve %>%
  mutate(Year = year(date), Month = as.character(month(date))) %>%
  filter(Year >= 1999) 
yield_curve1999

##PLOTTING GRAPH

yield_curve1999_plot <- yield_curve1999 %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x=maturity, 
             y=value, 
             group = Month, 
             color = as.character(Year))) +
  
    labs(title = "US Yield Curve from 1999 to 2020 for different bond maturities",
    subtitle = "Each Line within Each Subplot represents a particular Month",
    x = "Maturity",
    y = "Yield (%)",
    caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)") +
    facet_wrap(~Year, nrow=6, ncol=4) +
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE) +
    theme_wsj() +
    theme( panel.spacing = unit(2, "lines"), 
    plot.title = element_text(size = 18),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=15),
    axis.title.y=element_text(size=18),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10), 
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10), 
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10),
    strip.text = element_text(size=12)
  ) 

```

### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r yield_curve_3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
yield_curve_3 <- yield_curve %>% 
  mutate(year=year(date),month=month(date)) %>% 
  filter(year>=1999) %>% 
  filter(maturity == '3m' | maturity == '10y')
yield_curve_3  
  
yield_curve_3 %>% 
ggplot(aes(x=date,y=value,color=factor(duration,levels=unique(yield_curve_3$duration))))+
  geom_line()+
   labs(y = "%",
     x = NULL,
     title = "Yields on 3-month and 10-year US Treasury rates since 1999",
     caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold",size=15),
         axis.title.y = element_text(size=12),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12)
        )
```


According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?


Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

> This FRED graph effectively illustrates that every recession since 1957 has been preceded by a yield curve inversion. (Note that the lag between the inversion and a recession varies: With the 10-year and 1-year yields, the lag is between 8 and 19 months, with an average of about 13 months.) A common interpretation is that the yield curve measures investors’ expectations of economic growth in the current period compared with economic growth in the future. According to this interpretation, a yield curve inversion implies that investors expect current economic growth to exceed future economic growth, indicating that a recession is likely.

> Of course, some question the strength of the relationship between U.S. yield curves and recessions. The graph shows that, in 1965, the yield curve inverted but a recession didn’t closely follow. So, although yield curve inversions are good predictors of recessions, they’re not perfectly correlated and the exact relationship isn’t completely understood.
