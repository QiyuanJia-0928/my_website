#Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day)) %>% 
  filter(year >= 2015)
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.


```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
ggplot(bike, aes(bikes_hired)) +
  geom_density(scales = "free") +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(year), cols = vars(month)) +
  labs(x = "Bike Rentals",
       y = "",
       title = "Distribution of bikes hired per month") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(20000, 40000, 60000), 
                labels = c('20K', '40K', '60K'))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c()) +
  theme(axis.title.y=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_blank()) +
  theme_bw()
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

> May and June in 2019 had much more days with bike rentals across the mean compared to 2020 with a distribution that looks flatter. Overall, it seems that May and June 2020 had less bike rentals in total, potentially attributable to bad weather. Similarly it is possible that Covid may have caused people to go outside less, resulting in a lot of days with low number of bike rentals.

```{r}
bike_new1 <- bike %>% 
  mutate(date=ymd(day),mon=month(date,label=TRUE)) %>%
  filter(year>=2016 & year <=2021)  %>%
  group_by(mon) %>%
  summarize(monthly_mean=mean(bikes_hired)) 

bike_new2 <- bike %>%
  mutate(date=ymd(day),mon=month(date,label=TRUE)) %>%
  filter(year>=2016 & year <=2021)  %>%
  group_by(mon,year) %>%
  summarize(actual_month_rental=mean(bikes_hired))

bike_new3 <- left_join(bike_new1, bike_new2, by ="mon") %>% 
  mutate(delta_rental= actual_month_rental - monthly_mean,mon=as.numeric(mon))
   

months <- c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec")

bike_new3 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=mon)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=actual_month_rental),colour="black",size=0.3)+
  geom_line(aes(y=monthly_mean),colour="blue3",size=1)+
  facet_wrap(~year,nrow=2)+
    labs(title = "Monthly changes in TfL bike rentals", 
    subtitle = "Change from monthly average shown in blue and calculated between 2016-2019",   caption= "Source: TfL, London Data Store",
    x="Month", 
    y="Bike Rentals" ) +
  theme_bw()+
   scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12),
                   labels=months)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(xmin = 0, xmax = Inf,ymin=monthly_mean,ymax=monthly_mean+ifelse(actual_month_rental>monthly_mean, actual_month_rental-monthly_mean, 0)),fill="green",alpha=0.4)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(xmin = 0, xmax = Inf,ymin=monthly_mean,ymax=monthly_mean+ifelse(actual_month_rental>monthly_mean, 0,actual_month_rental-monthly_mean)),fill="red",alpha=0.4) +
   NULL

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks 14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).

```{r tfl_percent_change_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

  group_by(year, week) %>% 
  summarise(diff = (sum(bikes_hired) - average_weekly_bikes$avg)/average_weekly_bikes$avg) %>%
