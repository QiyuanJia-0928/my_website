<ul>
<li><p>I am an <strong>‘AND’</strong> person. I was brought up in <strong>China</strong> and <strong>Australia</strong>. I have lived and studied in <strong>China</strong>, <strong>Australia</strong>, <strong>US</strong> and <strong>UK</strong> and I love the intersection of mathematics, economics, and business. I am an <strong>ENT/FJ</strong>, and my favorite motto is <strong>‘draw closer and see behind the walls’</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>I have carried my interests through to my university studies. I had a semester exchange at <strong>Wharton Business School</strong> where I discovered my passion about impact. Last year, I graduated with a major of <strong>Actuarial Studies</strong> from <strong>University of Melbourne (Unimelb)</strong> and I am currently taking <strong>Honors in Actuarial Studies at Unimelb</strong> and the <strong>Masters in Financial Analysis at London Business School</strong> in parallel.</p></li>
<li><p>In the past, I have explored many opportunities through various internship ranging from <strong>insurtech</strong> to <strong>reinsurance</strong> to <strong>regulator</strong> to <strong>investment banking</strong>. The diversity of roles and multicultural experience, made me <strong>adaptive</strong> in a work environment and provided me with <strong>multiple perspectives of the business</strong> and more importantly <strong>discovery of myself</strong>. I love working in a fast-paced and diverse environment, and I enjoy the people facing element in a career.</p></li>
<li><p>I really love everyone I have met here at <strong>LBS</strong>! Shoutout to the best Data course ever!! In 2022, I will be joining <strong>Morgan Stanley Hong Kong office</strong> as an <strong>Investment Banking Off-cycle Intern</strong>. Hopefully, I will be back in London in not so long.</p></li>
<li><p>Outside of the studies, I enjoy a wide variety of sports：</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Badminton</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Running</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Swimming</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Golf</strong></p></li>
</ul>
