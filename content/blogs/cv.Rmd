* I am an **'AND'** person. I was brought up in **China** and **Australia**. I have lived and studied in **China**, **Australia**, **US** and **UK** and I love the intersection of mathematics, economics, and business. I am an **ENT/FJ**, and my favorite motto is **'draw closer and see behind the walls'**.

* I have carried my interests through to my university studies. I had a semester exchange at **Wharton Business School** where I discovered my passion about impact. Last year, I graduated with a major of **Actuarial Studies** from **University of Melbourne (Unimelb)** and I am currently taking **Honors in Actuarial Studies at Unimelb** and the **Masters in Financial Analysis at London Business School** in parallel.

* In the past, I have explored many opportunities through various internship ranging from **insurtech** to **reinsurance** to **regulator** to **investment banking**. The diversity of roles and multicultural experience, made me **adaptive** in a work environment and provided me with **multiple perspectives of the business** and more importantly **discovery of myself**. I love working in a fast-paced and diverse environment, and I enjoy the people facing element in a career.

* I really love everyone I have met here at **LBS**! Shoutout to the best Data course ever!! In 2022, I will be joining **Morgan Stanley Hong Kong office** as an **Investment Banking Off-cycle Intern**. Hopefully, I will be back in London in not so long.
